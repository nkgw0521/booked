This project is my personal attempt (as well as self-learning) to containerize the open-source [booked](https://www.bookedscheduler.com/) application, using [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
2 services (ie. containers) are made available:
+ web (a container with Apache and php with the mysqli module)
+ db (a container with MySQL)
